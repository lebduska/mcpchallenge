# MCP Challenge – Interaction Principles

Interactions should support experimentation, not performance pressure.

---

## 🧪 Core loop

Try → Observe → Adjust → Try again

Everything in the UI should reinforce this loop.

---

## 🎯 Prefer exploration over winning

Design for:
• curiosity
• iteration
• improvement
• discovery

Not for:
• urgency
• failure punishment
• high-pressure success states

---

## 🎛 Controls feel physical

Controls should resemble real-world adjustment tools.

Good:
• sliders
• drag gestures
• incremental changes
• live previews

Bad:
• numeric forms
• submit buttons
• config-style inputs

---

## 📈 Feedback is informational

Use feedback to explain system behavior.

Examples:
• trajectory preview
• heatmaps
• stress overlays
• highlighted state changes

Avoid:
• flashing win effects
• loud animations
• aggressive alerts

---

## 🧠 Show cause → effect

Every action should visually show its impact.

User changes parameter → world updates visibly.

No hidden effects.

---

## ⏱ Speed of iteration matters

Reset, retry, and adjust should be instant.

Never block experimentation with long flows.

---

## 🎨 Motion rules

Use motion only when it:
• shows change
• explains transition
• reinforces cause & effect

Never for decoration alone.

---

## 📊 Progress is subtle

Show:
• number of attempts
• improvement trends
• best result

Avoid:
• big score celebrations
• pressure metrics

---

## ✅ Interaction test

Ask for every feature:

Does this help someone understand the system better?

If not → simplify or remove.
